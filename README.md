Hola chicos I hope you're well

Here's a quick guide to stuff we'll do:

I need everyone of your to make an account here:
and retrieve your API key
Once you do that, you will have to create a .cdsapirc file
url: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api
key: <YOUR API KEY HERE>

so that you'll be able to query data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), not to be confused with the Coperniucs Climate Change Service (CDS)
