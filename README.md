Hola chicos I hope you're well

Here's a quick guide to stuff we'll do:

I need everyone of you to make an account here: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/
and retrieve your API key
Once you do that, you will have to create a .cdsapirc file (in your home directory), that looks like this 
url: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/api
key: <YOUR API KEY HERE>

so that you'll be able to query data from the Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS), not to be confused with the Coperniucs Climate Change Service (CDS)
to see how to query data from CDS, see the playground.ipynb notebook, where I'm trying a bunch of stuff
