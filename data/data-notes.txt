testing

All models are trained on the same feature set, just reshaped differently if needed

So we'll make the dataset considering ONE LOCATION for prediction (the Tehapachi pass, since there is a big wind farm there) and if this becomes too mundane, we can switch from prediciting wind speeds there, to predicting wind power generation, which is a bit more interesting.
We can also extend this 'one grid point' location to something else, maybe a 3x3 grid around it or something, we can get fancy

data will be taken hourly (I'm still not convinced, I think there is quarter-hourly). Maybe hourly is good either way

Tehapachi wind facility coordinates: 35.042933, -118.258788
the source of the dataset:
we're using the standard ERA5 single-levels API: (not the time-series one)
(NO WE'RE NOT, NO LONGER) ERA5 hourly time-series data on single levels from 1940 to present: https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/datasets/reanalysis-era5-single-levels-timeseries?tab=overview
could've used many other

discussion points in the report:
- why did we use that specific ERA5 source, there are many others
- 'lagged features' like the lagged wind speed ?
- wind has strong daily and seasonal cycles



TODO: consider adding more features, like time of day, day of year, etc. Those are called cyclical encodings ? 
    # cyclical encodings
    df["month_sin"] = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df["month"] / 12)
    df["month_cos"] = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df["month"] / 12)
    df["hour_sin"]  = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df["hour"] / 24)
    df["hour_cos"]  = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df["hour"] / 24)
    df["doy_sin"]   = np.sin(2 * np.pi * df["dayofyear"] / 365)
    df["doy_cos"]   = np.cos(2 * np.pi * df["dayofyear"] / 365)

features to consider in the future:
- u, v, mslp, sp, 2m, 
- pressure and pressure gradients ?
- total_cloud_cover
- surface_net_solar_radiation
- 2m_relative_humidity
- total_precipitation


- lagged features ? (SUPER POWERFUL)
df["wind_speed_lag_1h"] = df["wind_speed"].shift(1)
df["wind_speed_lag_3h"] = df["wind_speed"].shift(3)
df["wind_speed_lag_6h"] = df["wind_speed"].shift(6)
